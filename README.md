## Repository Description

Sudoku is a mathematical puzzle in which the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid divided into 3x3 sub-grids with the numbers 1 to 9 based on some numbers already arranged in some of the cells.

## Project Description

- What does the application do?
This application is a digital representation of the famous Sudoku game. With a user interface it recreates the game that is usually played with paper and pencil, on a screen. In addition to just representing the game, it also adds useful tools such as time, new game, score saving function, solution check and difficulties. Encouraging the user to play it to solve many more sudoku puzzles.

- What technologies does the application use and why?
The core project is based on HTML, JavaScript and CSS technologies. These technologies were used mainly because of how common they are nowadays. Besides that most of the applications that we use today depend on these 3 base technologies.

In addition to these four technologies, dependencies or libraries were also used, which are: 

1. **Electron:** This tool is the base on which the application is made, it is based on Chromium, besides having many dependencies included within itself, such as Node.js.


2. **Sweetalert2:** This library was mainly used to display alerts as forms, in this project it was mainly used to display the alert to save the user's name.

3. **Node.js:** This technology is basically used for the Backend section of the app. Specifically to connect the database.

4. **SQlite3** This technology was used for the implementation of the database.
         Built on Visual Studio Code
